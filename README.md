I have developed a machine learning system that analyzes chest X-ray scans to detect COVID-19 cases. This approach leverages artificial intelligence to identify the virus quickly and reliably, potentially improving the efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis. This technology represents a significant advancement in the fight against the pandemic.
